        <p class="project-description">This mock up site was created to show you how the flow of content can 
            affect a website. It is a very simplistic website that takes advatage 
            of how the content is laid out. The first thing to take note of is the main 
            content, it funnels down like a upside down pyramid. Layours like this fill 
            up the page & is pleasing on the visitors eyes without needing a complex layout.
            Notice how much blank space there is, but because of the symetry of the content and 
            how it's organized it's overlooked. Also pay attention to the site colors. It starts 
            with a dark blue and ends with the dark blue seperating the main content from the header 
            and footer. Also, the nice green color in the middle of the site content, notice how it 
            compliments the blue, and gives your helps to mentally fill up space and keep the content 
            organized.
