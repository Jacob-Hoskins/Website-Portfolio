        <p class="project-description">This is Country Cashew Butter. This page is created to show a couple different things. 
            How nautral colors affect visitors, how font affects visitors, and how a simple flow with 
            action words can affect the users. The natural colors I picked out for this site create a 
            calming feeling for the visitor, they are also natural earthy colors which follows the theme 
            of homemade cashew butter and this lets the user feel more trusting twoards the product. The 
            other thing to take note of is the font and how that makes you feel. A properly chosen font can help 
            bring out emotions and different feelings in a website visitor, and in this site the font is aimed 
            to bring a trusting feeling. The last thing to notice is not the amount of text on the site, but what 
            the text is saying. These words are action words and used to make the users mouth water, and make the user 
            hungry (specifically for this creamy cashew butter).
