        <p class="project-description">This simple game is meant to show how a website can interact
            with the user, or vice versa. Sometimes when a user clicks on something on your site you want 
            them to specifically know what they clicked on with some kind of animation, whether that be something 
            getting a little bigger or some complex background flair added along-side it. Maybe you need you user 
            to interact with something so that there can be some desired outcome, like someone winning a game, or something
            being added to a shopping cart. But not only that, there is also things happening behind the scene that the user
            doesnt see and should never see, like when they click on something how does the computer know what they clicked on?
            And when they press the confirm button what should happen after that, and how does clicking that confirm button set off
            a chain of events meant to lead to a final outcome? Well, you've came this far. I think you deserve a break, go on, play
            some rock paper scissors! Oh, and try going to the console in the developer tools when you use this site, it will give you
            some background for whats going on when you interact with the site.
