            Hi I'm Jacob, a freelance frontend developer from Ohio, then Pennsylvania and then back to Ohio.
            I create custom websites, or if a template created site like Wordpress will work better for your 
            business I can create one of those to! But keep in mind, a custom coded website and one that is created
            through templates each has its own benefits, and if you are not sure which one would suit you better just 
            let me know, I'm here for you! A big part of your website is how it looks, so before I even start to create
            your website I'll make multiple mock up designs from you to choose from, I believe you should be presented
            with the best options for your business and I'll make sure I do that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to me that I'm transparent and make sure that you get whats best for you (even if it means
            not getting your work). I would rather point you in the right direction for whats right for you instead of getting
            your work and giving you something thrown together and wasting your time and money. My goal is to solve your problems, not
            give you more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating and solving problems through code is a passion of mine. I started coding and programming in high school as a hobby
            and one day realized that my hobby was a skill that could be of use to people. And who doesnt want their hobby to help others
            achieve their goals and help them become more successful. 
        </p>

            While I'm not sitting infront of my computer working I'm normally walking my good ol boy Shrute (The Office definetly inspired
            his name), playing a game, or back infront of my computer working on side projects and trying to learn something new. Recently 
            I bought some bitcoin and I've been having fun working on projects some projects that scrap data involving bitcoin,
            and another that sends me a message once my bitcoin balance hits a certian value, so I know that I've made money. At least for five
            minutes and then it normally drops again.
