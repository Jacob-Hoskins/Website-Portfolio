            <p class="grabber-title">Do you really need a custom website?</p>
            <p class="grabber-1-p">Well, the short answer is no. If you want a thrown together website that you cant actually customize, 
                or even control, then sites like Godaddy, Wix, Wordpress will work great for you. Custom websites give
                you the ability to control your website and do whatever you need to make your business grow, 
                and bring in revenue to keep your business alive and thriving.

            <p class="grabber-title">Maybe a basic template is "good enough"</p>
            <p>Websites that give you a template to work with arn't made to help your business grow, they're made
                to keep you stuck on their platform. But when you have a custom website coded for your business in the
                future when you are looking to make a drastic change, it's easier and gives you more options.
